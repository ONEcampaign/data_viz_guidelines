# Interactivity

Interactivity plays an important role in enhancing the effectiveness and engagement of a data visualization. Complex arguments can be visualised in a much clearer way through interactive elements. However, poorly implemented interactivity can confuse, overwhelm and distract viewers. Using interactivity in a chart should be done carefully. Follow these guidelines to use interactivity effectively.

**Purpose driven**. Being able to add interactivity to a chart doesn’t mean all charts should be interactive. There should be a well defined purpose for the use of interactive elements in a chart. The main purpose of the chart is most important. If interactivity distracts from the main purpose, it should be static.

**Complement clarity, don’t substitute it**. Unless specifically built as an interactive tool requiring users to interact with it, a chart should not rely on interactive elements for clarity. A chart’s purpose should be clear as a static image. Interactive elements can then add more details and show more nuance.

**User centred design**. Interactive elements should be built with your target audience in mind - their technological proficiency, familiarity with charts, etc. Consider what devices your audience will use. Any interactive and UI element in a chart should be user friendly, with clear instructions on how they can be used. They should also be accessible to viewers with disabilities. Test interactive charts with others to understand if they are intuitive and easy to use or add confusion to a chart. If the chart’s final use will be static, do not include interactive elements when building the chart. This may confuse viewers and can make charts look less professional.
