# Design Process


There is more to designing a good chart than just picking a chart type and throwing some data into it. Here are some steps to follow when designing a chart to make sure
you are creating a chart that is clear, engaging, and fit for purpose.


## 1. Define the objective and audience
Before you start any work, make sure you have fully defined objective of the visualisation. What is the topic you are exploring, how have others approached the topic and visualised it, is there data or additional data you can use? What may be some biases you have in this topic? Who is your audience and what is their level of data and graph literacy?

## 2. Explore and understand the data
To build an effective and interesting visualisation you need to have a good understanding of the data. Using exploratory data visualisation is a good technique to find hidden stories in your data (See for example Anscombe's quartet). You should not explore data only to find things that support your desired argument (see more on quantitative analysis principles), but openly explore the data and reach conclusions and arguments based on what you find.

## 3. Choose a chart type 
Once you have an understanding of the argument and story you want to visualise, choose a chart type (standard or non standard) that best illustrates the point you want to make

## 4. Prepare the data and build the visual elements
This is the actual building step. Prepare the data for the visualisation. Depending on the method you are using to visualize the data (Flourish, Tableau, Excel, or scripting language) the data will need to be formatted in a specific way. Reach out to the data team for support, if you need it. Then start the build! Determine how to layer the visualization - which variables are shown on the x-axis, y-axis, which are shown as size, colour etc.

## 5. Add annotations, titles, explanations etc 
Think about guiding the viewer through the visualisation. Write an active and interesting title that succinctly describes the argument you are making. Add annotations and other non data elements to the chart that make it easy for the viewer to understand the chart. If needed, make sure you include legends .

## 6. Check accessibility and accuracy
Make sure the colours and opacities you have chosen are accessible to viewers who are colour blind or colour weak. If your visualisation is intended for the web or social media, draft an alternative text (alt text) to help viewers who have some visual impairment. Be aware of your audienceâ€™s literacy and ability to interpret your chart. Make sure your expected viewers who are least familiar with many data visualisation techniques can understand your chart. Clearly state where the data came from and how you are using and calculating it.

## 7. Review, test, iterate, and work with the data team 
Share your visualisation to get feedback. Assess how others interpret your visualisation and make changes if it is not how you intended viewers to interpret it. Iterate through this process multiple times until you are satisfied the visualisation accomplishes your intended goal. And check with the data team for help, feedback, and suggestions on your viz!
