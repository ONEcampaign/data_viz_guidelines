    <strong>We build charts that are clear, engaging and fit for purpose.</strong>
    <div>Our charts illustrate a clear point, and help our audience understand an argument and react to it. We are competing for space and attention so every decision we make must be justified. Simplicity and accuracy are important, but engagement is just as important, so we balance perceptual accuracy and engagement based on our objectives.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2">

<div class="card">
    <strong style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Clear single objective</strong>
    <div style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
        A chart should try to accomplish a single objective. This objective should be clear and obvious and charts should be designed to serve that purpose. Charts that have a single objective are usually clear and understandable. Charts that try to accomplish too many objectives (or none) are usually unclear and ineffective.

<div class="card">
    <strong style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Tell a story</strong>
    <div style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
        Add context to the chart to guide the viewer and help them understand the argument/story you are making. Use headings and annotations, explain unfamiliar concepts and highlight key insights and trends to make charts that are more engaging and clear.

<div class="card">
    <strong style="font-size: 1.2rem;">High data-to-ink ratio</strong>
    <div style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
        Maximise the amount of information conveyed in the chart relative to the amount of non-data elements used. Remove unnecessary elements, labels, and decorations, even axes (if they are unnecessary) to avoid clutter. It is still important to make aesthetically pleasing charts, but be mindful of the design decisions that you make, what they add and what they remove from a readerâ€™s ability to understand a chart.

<div class="card">
    <strong style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Use colour purposefully</strong>
    <div style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
        Colour impacts more than just the aesthetics of a chart, it affects its clarity, credibility, and engagement. Think carefully about which colours to use and what elements should be assigned (or not assigned) a colour; do not assign colours randomly. It is useful to start designing your visualisation with muted colours, like greys, to ensure it communicates the argument effectively without colour. When colour is needed, generally use fewer hues and use more shades of neighbouring colours.

<div class="card">
    <strong style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Show the right amount of relevant data</strong>
    <div style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
        Visualising complex issues is difficult. Choose the right amount of data to show in order to clarify the argument/story. At times arguments are clearer through simple charts using only aggregated measures like totals and averages. Other times arguments are clearer when more granular data is used to show nuances, outliers, and hidden trends.
