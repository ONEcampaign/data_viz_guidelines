# Data Visualisation Principles

Our Philosophy: We build charts that are clear, engaging and fit for purpose. Our charts illustrate a clear point, and help our audience understand an argument and react to it. We are competing for space and attention so every decision we make must be justified. Simplicity and accuracy are important, but engagement is just as important, so we balance perceptual accuracy and engagement based on our objectives.

Clear single objective
A chart should try to accomplish a single objective. This objective should be clear and obvious and charts should be designed to serve that purpose. Charts that have a single objective are usually clear and understandable. Charts that try to accomplish too many objectives (or none) are usually unclear and ineffective.

Tell a story
Add context to the chart to guide the viewer and help them understand the argument/story you are making. Use headings and annotations, explain unfamiliar concepts and highlight key insights and trends to make charts that are more engaging and clear.

High data-to-ink ratio
Maximise the amount of information conveyed in the chart relative to the amount of non-data elements used. Remove unnecessary elements, labels, and decorations, even axes (if they are unnecessary) to avoid clutter. It is still important to make aesthetically pleasing charts, but be mindful of the design decisions that you make, what they add and what they remove from a readerâ€™s ability to understand a chart.

Use colour purposefully
Colour impacts more than just the aesthetics of a chart, it affects its clarity, credibility, and engagement. Think carefully about which colours to use and what elements should be assigned (or not assigned) a colour; do not assign colours randomly. It is useful to start designing your visualisation with muted colours, like greys, to ensure it communicates the argument effectively without colour. When colour is needed, generally use fewer hues and use more shades of neighbouring colours.

Show the right amount of relevant data
Visualising complex issues is difficult. Choose the right amount of data to show in order to clarify the argument/story. At times arguments are clearer through simple charts using only aggregated measures like totals and averages. Other times arguments are clearer when more granular data is used to show nuances, outliers, and hidden trends.
