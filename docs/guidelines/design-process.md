# How to design a chart

Creating an effective chart involves much more than selecting a chart type and plugging in data.
A thoughtful, step-by-step process helps ensure your visualisation is clear, engaging, 
and fit for purpose. Below are the key stages to follow:

## 1. Define the Objective and Audience

Before doing anything else, clearly define the goal of your visualisation. 
What question are you answering or story are you telling? Consider:

- What topic are you exploring?
- How have others visualised this topic? 
- Do you have enough data—or is more data needed?
- Are there any assumptions or biases you should be aware of?

Equally important: **know your audience**. What is their familiarity with the subject? 
What is their level of data and graph literacy?

## 2. Explore and Understand the Data

To create a compelling and truthful chart, you need a deep understanding of the data. 
Use exploratory visualisation techniques to uncover patterns, outliers, or hidden stories 
(e.g. see Anscombe’s quartet).

Avoid selectively seeking evidence for a predetermined argument. Instead, approach the data openly
and allow your insights to emerge through exploration. (See also: principles of quantitative analysis.)

## 3. Choose the Right Chart Type

Once your message is clear, choose a chart type—standard or non-standard—that 
best supports your insight. Don’t default to the familiar; choose the chart that communicates the 
story most effectively and intuitively.

## 4. Prepare the Data and Build the Visual Elements

This is the hands-on stage. Prepare and format your data to suit the visualisation tool 
you're using (Flourish, Tableau, Excel, or a scripting language like R or Python). If you need help, 
reach out to the data team.

Then begin building:

- Decide which variables go on the x-axis, y-axis, or are represented by size, colour, shape, or animation.
- Think about layering, grouping, and how to direct the viewer’s attention.

## 5. Add Titles, Annotations, and Explanations

Guide your viewer through the visual:

- Write a **clear, active title** that communicates your main message.
- Use annotations to explain key insights or unusual data points.
- Include legends, labels, and notes where needed to reduce cognitive load and prevent misinterpretation.

## 6. Check for Accessibility and Accuracy

Ensure your visualisation is inclusive and accurate:

- Use colour palettes that are accessible for people with colour blindness or low vision.
- If you are publishing online, write **alt text** to describe the chart for screen readers.
- Know your audience’s comfort level with data and design accordingly.
- Clearly **cite your data sources**, explain your calculations, and be transparent about any transformations or assumptions.

## 7. Review, Test, Iterate (and Collaborate)

Share your draft with others:

- Ask for feedback to see how viewers interpret your chart.
- Watch for confusion, misinterpretation, or missed messages.
- Iterate—revise, refine, and retest—until the visualisation communicates exactly what you intend.

**Lastly, collaborate with the data team. We can provide support, peer review, 
and suggestions to strengthen your work.**
