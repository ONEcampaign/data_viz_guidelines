# Accessibility in data visualisation

Accessibility is often an overlooked part of the data visualisation design process—but it’s 
essential for making your data understandable and usable by everyone. Designing with accessibility in mind ensures 
that all users, regardless of ability, can access the insights you're sharing. 

Here are key considerations to keep in mind:


**Use of colour**<br>
Our [colour palette](/style-guide/colour-palette)
has been developed with accessibility in mind. 
However, you should always test your chosen colours for compatibility with users
who have colour vision deficiencies or other visual impairments. Use tools such as a
colour blindness simulator and contrast checker. As a general rule, **vary shade and lightness**, 
not just hue, to help differentiate between elements.


**Overall Design**<br>
Ensure that all text is legible and visual elements are clearly distinguishable. 
Avoid overcrowding—use adequate spacing and alignment to maintain clarity and focus.

**Chart literacy**<br>
Not every viewer is familiar with common data visualisation conventions. 
For example, while data experts may instantly recognise that a dot represents a 
data point, others may not. Always consider your audience and provide essential 
supporting elements such as titles, legends, annotations, and explanatory notes to guide interpretation.

**Device and Platform Considerations**<br>
Visualisations can appear differently across devices. Test your design on desktop,
tablet, and mobile to ensure responsiveness. If you're publishing to the web or 
social media, include alt text to support users with visual impairments.


A simple, effective structure for alt text is:

<p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
"<span style="color: #FF7F4C">[Chart type]</span> showing <span style="color: #FF7F4C">[data type]</span> where <span style="color: #FF7F4C">[reason for creating the chart]</span>."
</p>
