# Data visualisation principles

__We build charts that are clear, engaging and fit for purpose.__


Our charts illustrate a clear point, and help our audience understand an argument and react
to it. We are competing for space and attention, so every decision we make must be justified. 
Simplicity and accuracy are important, but engagement is just as important, so we balance 
perceptual accuracy and engagement based on our goals.

-   __Clear single objective__

    ---

    A chart should have one single clear objective. 
Charts with a single focus are easy to understand; those with multiple or 
unclear goals are often confusing.

-   __Tell a story__

    ---

    Add context to guide the viewer—use headings, annotations, and explanations to highlight key insights 
and make your chart clearer and more engaging.


-   __High data-to-ink ratio__

    ---

    Maximise information while minimising non-data elements. 
Remove clutter—like unnecessary labels, decorations, or even axes—while 
keeping the chart clear and visually appealing. Design choices should
enhance, not hinder, understanding.

-   __Use colour purposefully__

    ---

    Colour affects clarity, credibility, and engagement—don’t use it randomly. 
Start with muted tones to test your message, then add colour purposefully, 
using few hues and more shades of similar colours.

-   __Balance Simplicity and Detail__

    ---

    Visualising complex issues requires careful judgment. 
Show the right amount of data to support your story: sometimes 
simple charts with totals or averages work best; other times, 
detailed data reveals important nuances, outliers, or hidden trends.
