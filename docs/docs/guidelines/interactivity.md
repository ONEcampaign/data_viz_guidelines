# Interactive data visualisations

Interactivity can greatly enhance the effectiveness and engagement of a data 
visualisation, especially when communicating complex ideas. Interactive elements 
can help users explore, discover, and understand data more deeply. However, when poorly 
implemented, interactivity can confuse, overwhelm, or distract. It should always be applied 
intentionally and with care.

Here are key considerations to keep in mind:

**Purpose-driven design**<br>
It is easy to add interactive elements with modern editors like Flourish.
But just because interactivity is possible doesn’t mean it’s necessary. 
Use it only when it meaningfully enhances the chart’s purpose. If interactivity detracts from 
the main message or makes interpretation harder, a static version is likely more effective.

**Support clarity—don’t depend on it**<br>
Unless the chart is explicitly designed as a tool for exploration, 
it should still make sense as a static image. **Interactivity should enhance understanding, 
not be required for it**. Users should grasp the main insight immediately, with interactive 
elements revealing additional information layers or nuance.

**User-centered approach**<br>
Design interactivity with your audience in mind—their familiarity with data 
visualisations, comfort with digital tools, and the devices they’ll use. Interactive 
elements must be intuitive, accessible, and clearly explained. Provide clear prompts 
or instructions where needed. Always test your interactive charts with users to identify 
confusion or usability issues.


Finally, if the final version of the chart will be static (e.g. for print or a PDF report), 
avoid using interactive elements in your build. Including them in a non-interactive context 
can confuse viewers and reduce the professionalism of the final product.
